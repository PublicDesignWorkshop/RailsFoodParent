# Rails backend for the FoodParent app

Since Karl is going away, this is a repo that gets rid of the PHP side of the FoodParent app, since that will be the hardest to maintain in the future. Moving everything to Rails will also make it easier to build different applications off the back-end (like an email interface that lets you send photos of fruit trees and have them be auto-added to the map).
